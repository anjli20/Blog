      <p style="color: rgb(65, 64, 64);">
        Global Handwashing Day observed annually on October 15 to raise awareness and highlight the importance of
        handwashing as an effective means of disease prevention – this year marks a critical reminder for the world and
        the Region that this simple, cost effective practice can save lives.
<br><br>
        ‘Handwashing has always been one of most effective ways of keeping diseases at bay. It is a simple act that pays
        in dividends when it comes to keeping ourselves healthy and safe. Handwashing is also one of the key
        cornerstones of COVID-19 prevention. Now more than ever as we embrace the new normal and live with COVID-19,
        hand hygiene needs to become an integral part of our daily routine and our lives, as we live through this
        pandemic, and beyond, to protect us from diseases,’ said Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, Regional Director, WHO
        South-East Asia Region.
<br><br>
        With COVID-19 transmission mainly spreading between people through direct, indirect (through contaminated
        objects or surfaces), or close contact with infected people via mouth and nose secretions, washing hands with
        soap and running water is of critical importance. To stop the spread of COVID-19, along with other COVID
        appropriate behaviours, the practice of handwashing at regular intervals is a must, after coughing or sneezing,
        when caring for the sick, after using the toilet, before eating, while preparing food and after handling animals
        or animal waste. Handwashing after touching common surfaces such as doorknobs or handles, or after one comes
        back home from visiting a public place will keep ourselves and others around us safe.
