        Fashion, the style of clothing, style of looking different, style of talking and style of living, etc is now the
        need of various people who want to be and behave according to the changed outside environment. Fashion has been
        always a center of attraction for most people for many years. Generally, the trend of fashion has been viewed in
        young generation people. The trend of fashion depends on place to place, people to people or as per the interest
        according to need. Fashion always keeps changing and attracts mostly young age people. In India the world of
        glamour completely depends on fashion and also we can say that fashion is created by a glamorous world, where
        the everyday trends of fashion change.
<br><br>
        Being trendy and fashionable is just your own wish, no one can force you to do it and it is your own decision
        that how much and what type of fashion you are preferring according to place and requirement. Though this time
        of the 21st century in India mostly people are affected by the glamorous world and style of fashion still they
        have not forgotten our traditions and culture which is the priority and symbol of our country.
